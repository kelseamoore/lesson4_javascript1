### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. This lesson introduces JavaScript, which is a client-side programming language that makes a static webpage dynamic.
2. JavaScript is a loosely written programming language and using comments in the code can be very beneficial for the author and others who look at the code. Single line comments are added with "//", and multiple line comments are added with "/* */."
3. Variables are an important part of JavaScript. Variables are used to store data, which are stored by assigning a certain name to the variable. Variables names are case-sensitive and must start with a letter or an underscore.
